uii â€“ usable irc it

synopsis:
    uii is a wrapper for the minimalistic irc client irc it.
    if ii is not running and connected to a server, it will be started.

    uii uses iiinotify, a shell script that uses inotify to monitor irc directory.
    for messages not displayed in an existing uii instance, a notification is shown.

usage:
    ./uii [server] [channel]

dependencies:
    uii depends on grep, ii, lsof, nohup, pgrep, rlwrap, sh, splitvt and tail.
    iiinotify depends on inotifywait, notify-send and uii.

bugs:
    - to quit uii you have to input ^C twice, for view and input shell.
    - for X11 copy and paste, hold shift (due to splitvt fail).
    - the irc directory is hardcoded to "$HOME/irc".
    - uii has no channel nick name list.
