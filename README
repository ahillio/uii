uii â€“ usable irc it

synopsis:
    uii is a wrapper for the minimalistic irc client irc it.
    if ii is not running and connected to a server, it will be started.

    uii uses iiinotify, a shell script that uses inotify to monitor irc directory.
    for messages not displayed in an existing uii instance, a notification is shown.

usage:
    ./uii server channel [nickname] [password]

    to quit uii, press ^D; alternatively, press ^C twice or ^O, then q.
    to mark text or insert it using X11 copy and paste, hold shift.

dependencies:
    uii depends on grep, ii, lsof, nohup, pgrep, rlwrap, sed, sh, splitvt, tail and tput.
    iiinotify depends on inotifywait, notify-send and uii.

bugs:
    - channels with slashes in them are not accessible (due to ii fail).
    - rxvt may produce artifacts when uii output scrolls.
    - resizing the terminal fucks up the layout.
    - uii has no channel nick name list.
