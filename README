uii â€“ usable irc it

synopsis:
    uii is a wrapper for the minimalistic irc client irc it.
    ii must be running and connected to a server for uii to work.

    iiinotify is a shell script that uses inotify to monitor irc directory.
    for query messages and those containing $USER, a notification is shown.
    additionally, iiinotify opens new terminals with uii for query messages.

usage:
    ./uii [server] [channel]

    ./iiinotify

dependencies:
    uii depends on ii, pgrep, sh, splitvt and tail.
    iiinotify depends on inotifywait and uii.

bugs:
    - to quit uii you have to input ^C twice, for view and input shell.
    - uii breaks X11 copy and paste (due to splitvt fail).
    - the irc directory is hardcoded to "$HOME/irc".
    - iiinotify monitors unnecessary events.
    - uii has no channel nick name list.
