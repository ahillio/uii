uii â€“ usable irc it

synopsis:
    uii is a wrapper for the minimalistic irc client irc it.
    if ii is not running and connected to a server, it will be started.

    uii uses iiinotify, a shell script that uses inotify to monitor irc directory.
    for messages not displayed in an existing uii instance, a notification is shown.

usage:
    uii server [channel] [nickname] [password]

    to quit uii, input ^C.

configuration:
    the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uii/logins should contain three space-delimited values per line, represening server, username and password.
    configuration values are used only if no command line options for nickname and password are given.

dependencies:
    uii depends on awk, ii, inotifywait, lsof, nohup, pgrep, ping, rlwrap, sed, sh, stdbuf and tput.
    iiinotify depends on notify-send and uii.

    on a debian-based system, you should be able to install all of them using:
    apt-get install coreutils dash ii inotify-tools iputils-ping libnotify-bin lsof mawk ncurses-bin procps rlwrap sed

bugs:
    - channels with slashes in them are not accessible (due to ii fail).
    - (u)rxvt may produce artifacts when uii output scrolls.
    - resizing the terminal fucks up the layout.
    - uii has no channel nick name list.

    uii is licensed under the GPL, either version 3 or any later versiona as published by the FSF.
    uii was written by Nils Dagsson Moskopp (erlehmann).
