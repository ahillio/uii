uii â€“ usable irc it

synopsis:
    uii is a shell script for the minimalistic irc client irc it.
    ii must be running and connected to a server for uii to work.

usage:
    ./uii [server] [channel]

bugs:
    - to quit uii you have to input ^C twice, for view and input shell.
    - the irc directory is hardcoded to "$HOME/irc".
    - uii does not support queries.
